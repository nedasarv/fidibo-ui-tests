# 📘 Fidibo UI Tests (Cypress E2E)

This project contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for the login functionality of the [Fidibo](https://fidibo.com) website, developed using the **Cypress** framework. The tests cover successful and unsuccessful login scenarios using various authentication methods.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Login with valid email and password
- ❌ Login failure with invalid credentials
- Organized and extensible project structure
- Secure use of environment variables (`cypress.env.json`)
- Designed for future enhancements: OTP login and Google login

---

## 🔐 Login Methods on Fidibo

Fidibo offers three login methods for users:

- 📧 **Email & Password Login** ✅  
  Fully implemented and tested.

- 📱 **Mobile Number & OTP Login** 🔜  
  Requires mocking the OTP API or simulating SMS code reception.

- 🧠 **Login with Google Account (OAuth)** 🔜  
  Uses a popup-based OAuth flow, which is not directly testable in Cypress unless stubbed or mocked.
