#  Fidibo UI Tests (Cypress E2E)

This project contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for the login functionality of the [Fidibo](https://fidibo.com) website, developed using the **Cypress** framework. The tests cover successful and unsuccessful login scenarios using various authentication methods.

---

##  Features

-  Login with valid email and password
-  Login failure with invalid credentials
- Organized and extensible project structure
- Secure use of environment variables (`cypress.env.json`)
- Designed for future enhancements: OTP login and Google login

---

##  Login Methods on Fidibo

Fidibo offers three login methods for users:

-  **Email & Password Login** 
  Fully implemented and tested.

-  **Mobile Number & OTP Login** ðŸ”œ  
  Requires mocking the OTP API or simulating SMS code reception.

-  **Login with Google Account (OAuth)** ðŸ”œ  
  Uses a popup-based OAuth flow, which is not directly testable in Cypress unless stubbed or mocked.
